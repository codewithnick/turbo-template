/**
 * The wordmark drawn as strokes — the "signature" effect, done with framer's
 * pathLength rather than GSAP's DrawSVG so it needs no plugin.
 *
 * "S", "R" and "Clarke" draw IN PARALLEL: all three groups start together, so
 * the mark assembles in roughly the time one letter takes instead of crawling
 * through ten. Within a group the strokes still stagger, because that is what
 * makes each letter read as written rather than as parts appearing.
 *
 * This is a CANDIDATE, rendered only on the drawn-wordmark lab page. The
 * shipped logo is components/wordmark.tsx, which is real type.
 *
 * Why hand-drawn paths: a draw-on animation needs the centreline of each
 * letter, and fonts contain outlines. MorphSVGPlugin.convertToPath() converts
 * SVG <text> into a filled outline, which cannot be stroked open — so the
 * GSAP demo's technique does not solve this, and the letterforms are drawn by
 * coordinate.
